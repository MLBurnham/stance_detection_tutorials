    "#### This tutorial demonstrates stance detection using a few-shot approach with GPT-3. In-context learning and few-shot classification is a fast moving field and this is a relatively simple implementation. Consider this a starting point rather than a comprehensive guide. This guide will use the openai library to gain access to GPT-3 and utilize their cloud computing services. OpenAI charges based on usage and this can be fairly expensive. However, new accounts are given a small stipend to play with. This should be enough to run through this tutorial.\n",
